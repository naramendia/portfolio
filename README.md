**Figure 1: Decentralized Index of COMP token**

Source: created by [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/) using data from [SoK: Blockchain Decentralization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04256)

Figure 1 represents the decentralization index of the COMP token from June 2020 to November 2022. The Y-axis shows the value of the index and the X-value shows the date. This visualization is a scatterplot, and it becomes less decentralized and less variance as time goes on. The dots become closer together as they approach the end of year 2022.
